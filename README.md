Gas Leak Detection using MQ-5 Gas Sensor with Arduino & LED

This project demonstrates how to use the MQ-5 Gas Sensor with an Arduino to detect gas concentration levels.
When the gas level crosses a specified threshold, an LED indicator turns ON.

Components Required

Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

MQ-5 Gas Sensor

LED

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

Working Principle

The MQ-5 gas sensor outputs an analog value representing the gas concentration.
The Arduino reads this value via an analog pin (A0) and compares it with a set threshold.

If gas concentration â‰¥ threshold â†’ LED turns ON

If gas concentration < threshold â†’ LED remains OFF
